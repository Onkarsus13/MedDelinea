# MedDelinea: Scalable and Efficient Medical Image Segmentation via Controllable Diffusion Transformers

**üìå Accepted at MIDL 2025**

---

## üß† Overview

**MedDelinea** is a novel framework for medical image segmentation that combines the strengths of diffusion models and transformers. Our approach introduces **controllability and scalability** into the segmentation process, enabling accurate, efficient, and interpretable delineation of complex medical structures across a variety of imaging modalities.

Key highlights:
- Combines **controllable diffusion** with **transformer-based architectures**
- Demonstrates strong performance across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
- Efficient inference with competitive parameter count
